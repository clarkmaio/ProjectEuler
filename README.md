# ProjectEuler
**Project Euler** is [this](https://projecteuler.net/).
It is a collection of problems (mostly related to algebra and algorithms).

Once you have solved the problems you can submit the solutions to verify if they are correct.
Here I will present the solutions I've found to the problems I've solved.

I will try to give not only the solution but also the *time performance* of the scripts.

Have fun ( :
