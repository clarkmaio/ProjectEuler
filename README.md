# ProjectEuler
**Project Euler** is [this](https://projecteuler.net/).
It is a collection of problems (mostly related to algebra and algorithms).

Once you have solved the problem you can submit the solution to verify if it is correct.
Here I will present the solution I've found to the problems I've solved.

I will try to give not only the solution but also the *running time* of the scripts that solve the problem.

Have fun ( :
